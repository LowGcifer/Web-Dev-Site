# Web-Dev-Site

This is my personal website for full-stack web development. It contains a page for home, about me, services, and a contact page.
It is a static react app. A server folder was created in anticipation for a custom backend, but it will likely be unused. It will
be deleted before deployment to clean up the repo.
